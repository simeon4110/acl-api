# Arts Criticism Lab Public Source

This repository contains the currently deployed version of the code running at https://acriticismlab.org. Contributions to the code base are welcomed, anyone is free to create a merge request or fork the code to run on another site.

The code is all Spring Boot (Security, Hibernate, JPA, MVC) based on the back end, and angular on the front end (the front-end code is not in this repo). There is very little deviation from the standard Spring MVC design pattern. 

All of the project's code and dependencies are open source, but not all of the dependencies are licenced under the same agreement: please ensure you have read and understood any licencing requirements before you put this code into production. The code in this repository is all licensed under the GPL-3.0 license.
